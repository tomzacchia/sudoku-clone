## About The Project

I was recently going over some React topics by [Academind](https://github.com/academind) and wanted to challenge myself by building a decently complex application without any guidance. At the same time I wanted use functional programming, where appropriate, to handle data manipulation between state changes. I have been a long time user of [Sudoku.com's](https://sudoku.com/) mobile application and appreciate many of their great features that make the game easier to play, compared to traditional Sudokus on paper.

## Built With

## Roadmap

- [x] Persist user data in localStorage
- [x] Get game data from API
- [x] Highlighting user selection as well as any errors
- [ ] Add feature for writing notes
- [ ] Add highlighting all values indentical to user selectio (i.e all 4s on board highlighted)
- [ ] Redux to cleanly control transition between game states (new game, restart, note mode, window refresh)
